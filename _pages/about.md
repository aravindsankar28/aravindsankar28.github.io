I am a Research Scientist in the [Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/core-data-science/) team at [Meta Research](https://research.facebook.com/). My research work spans data mining, applied machine learning, and computational social science domains, with a focus on <i>recommender systems</i> and <i>graph mining</i>.

Prior to joining Meta, I graduated with a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.illinois.edu) from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu). During my PhD, I worked on robust user behavior modeling in large-scale social networking and online interaction platforms. My PhD thesis research includes designing robust graph neural networks and neural collaborative filtering models for graph representation learning, personalized recommendation, and social interaction modeling applications.


I was fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Crowd Dynamics Lab](https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/), and have actively collaborated with [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).
<!-- and [Prof. Kevin Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang). -->
I have worked as a research intern in the <i>Computational Social Science</i> team at [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/) (Summer 2020), <i>Recommendations</i> and <i>Risk Modeling</i> teams at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html) (Summers 2019, 2018), and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) (Summer 2014).


I received my Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2016.
I worked with Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sayan" target="_blank">Sayan Ranu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/karthik/" target="_blank"> Karthik Raman</a> on developing a scalable graph mining algorithm for automated chemical reaction and pathway prediction. Our work has been featured in the [Hindu newspaper](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/iit-researchers-develop-tool-to-synthesise-new-molecules/article9896254.ece).



I grew up almost entirely in Chennai except for the first few years of my childhood that I spent in the US. I&#39;m a big sports buff, can spend hours watching any sport, be it Cricket, Tennis (a huge Federer fan!), Basketball, Football, F1 and more, while I play Tennis and Table Tennis. I also play the keyboard in the Carnatic genre and have given a couple of concerts in the past. This has given me a deep interest in Carnatic music that I hope to pursue more seriously in the future. I like reading books, some of my favorite authors being Dan Brown, John Grisham, Michael Connelly to name a few. I enjoy the adrenaline rush from hiking, biking, and outdoor sports.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
