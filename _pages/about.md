I am a third year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
My research interests lie at the intersection of user behavior modeling in online social media and large-scale graph mining.
Specifically, my research involves devising neural network architectures for
recommender systems, social influence modeling and graph representation learning.
I am advised by Prof. [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Crowd Dynamics Lab](https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/).
<!-- I have also worked with [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Kevin Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang). -->
I have worked as a research intern at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html) (Summers 2019, 2018), and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) (Summer 2014).


I received my Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2016.
I was working with Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sayan" target="_blank">Sayan Ranu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/karthik/" target="_blank"> Karthik Raman</a> on developing a graph mining framework for automated chemical reaction and pathway prediction. Our work has been featured in the [Hindu newspaper](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/iit-researchers-develop-tool-to-synthesise-new-molecules/article9896254.ece).



I grew up almost entirely in Chennai except for the first few years of my childhood that I spent in the US. I&#39;m a big sports buff, can spend hours watching any sport, be it Cricket, Tennis (a huge Federer fan!), Basketball, Football, F1 and more, while I play Tennis and TT. I also play the keyboard in the Carnatic genre and have given a couple of concerts in the past. This has given me a deep interest in Carnatic music that I hope to pursue more seriously in the future. I like reading books, some of my favorite authors being Dan Brown, John Grisham, Michael Connelly to name a few. I enjoy the adrenaline rush from hiking and outdoor sports.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
